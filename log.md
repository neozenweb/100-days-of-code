### Day 18: February 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the deploying the app on Heroku with buildpack for React through Heroku-cra-node git repo. It took a lot of effort to distinguish between the development and production deployment. Still needs lot of work on the server calls for data. https://fast-springs-64386.herokuapp.com/
***Thoughts:*** Very glad to have the app deployed on the Heroku site. Once the data paths are fixed, more work is needed on the look and feel of the app.


### Day 17: February 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Deployed the app locally on Heroku. Trying to deploy the app in production environment on Heroku.
***Thoughts:*** Have to look into the React buildpack for Heroku.

***Thoughts:*** Have to research about Free Code Camp courses API.

### Day 13: January 31, 2019

***Thoughts:*** React setState from parent component and fetching data from the server is a bit confusing.

### Day 12: January 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: With some great tips from Stack Overflow advisor, I realized that I have to build Express server on node.js and then connect the data to the front end react. Today, I coded the server and tested that the data is being retrieved properly.
***Thoughts:*** API Docs need to be more clear about the frontend/backend accessibility to avoid confusion.


### Day 11: January 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: One last day of struggle with the 403-Forbidden error with the JWT token access to EdX API.

### Day 10: January 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Code is running into problems with Fetch + JWT Token + headers and gives a 403-Forbidden error. Meanwhile, I have learned how to use the chrome dev tools to trace the request in the curl or fetch format.

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu app: Worked on the EdX headers for the api.

**Thoughts:**  The headers for the EdX work fine and get the results in the curl format but the javascript version is giving a access forbidden error!! on localhost.

### Day 6: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu app: Included Home page access on menu. Worked to fix some bugs on the menu.

**Thoughts:**  Would a side by side listing of courses work better? or not may be because that would slow down the app.

### Day 5: January 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Deployed MyReads project on Github. Changed the myedu programs to search keywords in course title or descriptions instead of subjects.

### Day 4: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyReads Project: This was a project from the udacity course, that I am not able to somehow deploy on github pages. I am making some changes to router and other links in the .js files.

### Day 3: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Successful in accessing the APIs for EdX and Coursera, though the EdX API gives Timeout Gateway error sometimes???

**Thoughts:**  Have to decide about classifying this data based on subject or search keyword.

### Day 2: January 20, 2019

### Day 1: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Trying to play around with Bootstrap and React for the website.

**Thoughts:**  Will linking the BootStrap stylesheet be sufficient for this project or should I dig deeper into React-Bootstrap components?? https://react-bootstrap.github.io/

### Day 0: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: The data from Udacity API, which are mainly computer science courses, is now shown on the page along with the links for more information about each course.
