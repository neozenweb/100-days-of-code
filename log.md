# NeoZenWeb- 100 Days Of Code- Take 2 - Log
### Day 8: January 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu app: Still struggling with the EdX API authorization to work through ajax. Did Bird Migration problem on Hackerrank and reviewed javascript objects :) 

**Thoughts:**  Got to dig deeper into APIs and CORS and authorization header etc.

### Day 7: January 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu app: Worked on the EdX headers for the api.

**Thoughts:**  The headers for the EdX work fine and get the results in the curl format but the javascript version is giving a access forbidden error!! on localhost.

### Day 6: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu app: Included Home page access on menu. Worked to fix some bugs on the menu.

**Thoughts:**  Would a side by side listing of courses work better? or not may be because that would slow down the app.

### Day 5: January 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Deployed MyReads project on Github. Changed the myedu programs to search keywords in course title or descriptions instead of subjects.

**Thoughts:**  Getting the authentication for EdX API should help the application.

### Day 4: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyReads Project: This was a project from the udacity course, that I am not able to somehow deploy on github pages. I am making some changes to router and other links in the .js files.

**Thoughts:**  Updating the status of new books through the search button, needs to be fixed.

### Day 3: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Successful in accessing the APIs for EdX and Coursera, though the EdX API gives Timeout Gateway error sometimes???

**Thoughts:**  Have to decide about classifying this data based on subject or search keyword.

### Day 2: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Completed the navigation bar with both the dropdowns conditionally populated.

**Thoughts:**  Next step is to access data from the different APIs based on the selected subject and provider.

### Day 1: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Trying to play around with Bootstrap and React for the website.

**Thoughts:**  Will linking the BootStrap stylesheet be sufficient for this project or should I dig deeper into React-Bootstrap components?? https://react-bootstrap.github.io/

### Day 0: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: The data from Udacity API, which are mainly computer science courses, is now shown on the page along with the links for more information about each course.

**Thoughts:**  Before gathering data from EdX and Coursers APIs, I have to code another select component to let the user have a choice.
