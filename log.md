# NeoZenWeb- 100 Days Of Code- Take 2 - Log


### Day 0: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: The data from Udacity API, which are mainly computer science courses, is now shown on the page along with the links for more information about each course.

**Thoughts:**  Before gathering data from EdX and Coursers APIs, I have to code another select component to let the user have a choice.

### Day 0: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: MyEdu project: Trying to play around with Bootstrap and React for the website.

**Thoughts:**  Will linking the BootStrap stylesheet be sufficient for this project or should I dig deeper into React-Bootstrap components?? https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
